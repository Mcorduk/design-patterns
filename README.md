# Design Patterns Playground

This repository documents my journey of learning and implementing design patterns, primarily inspired by O'Reilly's Design Patterns book. Here, you'll find code examples, explanations, and resources for each pattern, serving as a personal reference and hopefully benefiting others along the way.

**Structure:**

- Folders are organized by design pattern categories: Creational, Structural, Behavioral.
- Within each category, individual pattern folders contain:
  - `README.md`: Explains the pattern's concept, purpose, benefits, usage examples with code snippets, and real-world applications.
  - Named Folders: Implements code as an example of the design pattern being used.

**Why Learn Design Patterns**

Patterns allow you to say more with less. When you use a pattern in a description, other developers quickly know precisely the design you have in mind.
Talking at the pattern level allows you to stay “in the design” longer. Talking about software systems using patterns allows you to keep the discussion at the design level, without having to dive down to the nitty-gritty details of implementing objects and classes.

**Current Progress:**

This repository is under active development. Currently, I'm focusing on the Introductory designs. More patterns will be added as I progress through the book and beyond.

**Disclaimer:**

This repository is for educational purposes only. The code examples are meant to illustrate the concepts and may not be production-ready.

**Enjoy!**

I hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone learning design patterns. Feel free to explore, use the code, and share your feedback!
